## Overview

Describe your forum application here - in about 250 words, i.e., how does it work? How do the TAs/markers test your application?
This forum application has composed of 5 main pages: 
-the index shows all posts made by all users in chronological order from newest to oldest,
-the register page which is only accessible to users not logged in,
-the login page which is also only accessible when not logged in,
-the messages page which only logged in users can access allows them to send messages to other users and to check their messaging history
-the posts page which allows logged in users to view all their past posts and to create new posts

Also, the header uses a contextual drop down menu which is only viewable by logged in users, allowing them to access the messaging and posting pages
