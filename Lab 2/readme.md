I chose the field "product or service name" as it would make it more clear what type of help the client needs form the get go.

I chose to validate if the form had submitted by checking if the keys i used as names for the variables were in the POST array, with this method i can check for all of the variables at once and it doesnt matter if one or two are submitted right, the form will still be rejected unless all 4 variables were recieved correctly.
